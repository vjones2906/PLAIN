## Phase_0
### Week 1
#### Reflection

This week we worked on our planning document. We created, outlined, and filled in most of our google doc. We drew up our first sketches and calculated the cost of parts while also starting to outline our timeline. This week was mainly talking with Afton's group and brainstorming how we wanted to do the linkage.

### Week 2
#### Reflection

This week we completed our planning document. We finished the timeline, code blocks, and the rest of the google doc. Then we created a github repo and moved all of the information from the doc to the github planning document. We fleshed out a more concrete plan with aftons group and made our schedueles so that there was a lot of overlap and we would check in every now and then.

### Week 3
#### Reflection

This week we prototyped the PLAIN with shop materials. Vinnie was out sick this week so Matthias had to take charge and created our prototype. Matthias made it out of wood, styrofoam, a 9v battery, and a motor. The prototype did not fly and was not areodynamic at all. The only thing that worked was the switch that was soldiered to the motor and turned it on. We decided that it was best to move on with the project and not waste too much time trying to made a working prototype.

## Phase_1
### Week 4
#### Reflection

This week we worked together to make the first prototype in CAD. A general style was followed rather than planning for real world functionality. The only thing that was made to realistic standards was the air foil of the aft horizontal stabilizers. The air foil was made with a spline and modeling a common RC plane air foil.

### Week 5
#### Reflection

This week Vinnie started the code, and as a proof of concept he wanted to wire a potentiometer to a motor and have it cotrol the speed using the map function. He also orderd the RC components to hopefully start working on it asap. Matthias started a new CAD design and thought it would be a good idea to make the fuselage deign layer by layer and then connect them by two pins.

### Week 6
#### Reflection

This week we cut and built the prototype for the rib design. The laser printed pins didn't fit tightly all the way through and there was no plan on how to connect the wings so it turned out just to be a losely fitting body. Vinnie also worked on getting the RC to work and eventually got a succesful wireless conection and it turned on lights on command.

## Phase_2
### Week 7
#### Reflection

This week Matthias tried to fix the prototype while Vinnie worked on getting the RC to give signals that he was able to recieve and use as inputs in his code. The rib prototype did not end up looking redeemable to matthias and after much frustration it was scrapped. Vinnie got a servo to be able to turn using only RC as inputs.

### Week 8
#### Reflection

This week Matthias tried a new cad design that HIGHLY resembled a neighboring groups CAD. Aside from the apparent problems, the biggest one was that the design he was "inspired by" was meant to be a glider and in no way had the design intention of gaining speed and producing lift with a motor. Vinnie continued working with the RC and expirimented with the wiring. He also ordered the motor so that he could start working on it.

## Phase_3
### Week 9
#### Reflection

This week we were supposed to work on linkage with Afton's team but both of our groups were not ready to link yet. Matthias scrapped the copycat design and then started working on a more solid design that we will hopefully use in the final design. Vinnie started working on voltage dividers so there could be one power source that powers the pico and motors together.

### Week 10
#### Reflection

This week we were supposed to code the delink protocol and complete the prototype with link. Neither of these things happened because Matthias was still working on his design for CAD and hadn't laser cut it yet. Vinnie was still working on the voltage dividers and experimenting with Mr. Miller's resitor book with many different types of resistors. Matthias also put the servo mount on to the bottom of the wings so that it would be easy to control the flap movement, this idea was also used by matthew and afton on their first iteration.

### Week 11
#### Reflection

This week we were supposed to touch up the delink/motor/rc, figuring out weight, first successful solo flights. None of these were acheivable. The link had not been finished, yet alone started with Afton's group. The motor came but Vinnie was busy trying to figure out voltage dividers. The RC needed the motor to be finished, and the PLAIN hadn't been fabricated so the weight and flight could not be acheived. This week matthias got closer to the finished product in CAD and Vinnie realized he didn't actually need the voltage divider from the 9v because the actual motor needed many more amps than a 9v with split outputs had to offer. Vinnie started to catch up on the documentation.

## Phase_4
### Week 12
#### Reflection

This week we were supposed to plan with Aftonâ€™s team for linked takeoff but we could neither link nor takeoff. Matthias worked on the last weight reductions and was close to done. Vinnie kept working on the documentaion and caught up to the current date. Vinnie also searched the back for a battery and charger that they could use in the PLAIN.

### Week 13
#### Reflection

This week we decided to scrap the connection launch because both teams were to far behind to have enough time to test and get good results. Matthias worked on making the wings thinner and hopefully reducing the weight of the plain overall, the wing change was also realized because we did not need such a tall airfoil and the length was going to be more important. This was achieved by changing the shape of the airfoil making every part of the airfoil 1mm thick. Vinnie worked on the motor votlage and found the right resistor for the job.

### Week 14
#### Reflection

This week we both decided it would be a good idea to move on from the round design of our fusalage to a more square design that would be both easier to make and would allow for all of our electronics to fit better in the fusalage and have a better centre of mass. Matthias also found a new design that we agreed was a good idea to model off of. With the new design Matthias decided to move the servos onto the fusalage and put the wings onto the top of the plain which we believe would allow for more lift.

### Week 15
#### Reflection

This week Matthias worked on readjusting the plain to make it more aerodynamic and changing the way that the front was angled and adding more supports for the wing connection. Additionally, Matthias put on the back of the fusalage and used a friction fit design which incorperated a 2.45mm diameter metal rods in order to connect the peices together. Matthias used both sketches and fillets in order to make the plain more aerodynamic and also had trouble because the bottom corners of the fuslage were too thin so he had to add a little more filling on the inside of the plain, he did this by using a conic as the top and using the bottom edge of the fuselage to create a sketch then extruded that sketch 2mm into the fuslage to fix the thin issue.
