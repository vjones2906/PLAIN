## Phase_0
### Week 1
#### Reflection

This week we worked on our planning document. We created, outlined, and filled in most of our google doc. We drew up our first sketches and calculated the cost of parts while also starting to outline our timeline. This week was mainly talking with Afton's group and brainstorming how we wanted to do the linkage.

### Week 2
#### Reflection

This week we completed our planning document. We finished the timeline, code blocks, and the rest of the google doc. Then we created a github repo and moved all of the information from the doc to the github planning document. We fleshed out a more concrete plan with aftons group and made our schedueles so that there was a lot of overlap and we would check in every now and then.

### Week 3
#### Reflection

This week we prototyped the PLAIN with shop materials. Vinnie was out sick this week so Matthias had to take charge and created our prototype. Matthias made it out of wood, styrofoam, a 9v battery, and a motor. The prototype did not fly and was not areodynamic at all. The only thing that worked was the switch that was soldiered to the motor and turned it on. We decided that it was best to move on with the project and not waste too much time trying to made a working prototype.

## Phase_1
### Week 4
#### Reflection

This week we worked together to make the first prototype in CAD. A general style was followed rather than planning for real world functionality. The only thing that was made to realistic standards was the air foil of the aft horizontal stabilizers. The air foil was made with a spline and modeling a common RC plane air foil.

### Week 5
#### Reflection

This week Vinnie started the code, and as a proof of concept he wanted to wire a potentiometer to a motor and have it cotrol the speed using the map function. He also orderd the RC components to hopefully start working on it asap. Matthias started a new CAD design and thought it would be a good idea to make the fuselage deign layer by layer and then connect them by two pins.

### Week 6
#### Reflection

This week we cut and built the prototype for the rib design. The laser printed pins didn't fit tightly all the way through and there was no plan on how to connect the wings so it turned out just to be a losely fitting body. Vinnie also worked on getting the RC to work and eventually got a succesful wireless conection and it turned on lights on command.

## Phase_2
### Week 7
#### Reflection

This week Matthias tried to fix the prototype while Vinnie worked on getting the RC to give signals that he was able to recieve and use as inputs in his code. The rib prototype did not end up looking redeemable to matthias and after much frustration it was scrapped. Vinnie got a servo to be able to turn using only RC as inputs.

### Week 8
#### Reflection

This week Matthias tried a new cad design that HIGHLY resembled a neighboring groups CAD. Aside from the apparent problems, the biggest one was that the design he was "inspired by" was meant to be a glider and in no way had the design intention of gaining speed and producing lift with a motor. Vinnie continued working with the RC and expirimented with the wiring. He also ordered the motor so that he could start working on it.
