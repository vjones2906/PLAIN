## Phase_0
### Week 1
#### Reflection

This week we worked on our planning document. We created, outlined, and filled in most of our google doc. We drew up our first sketches and calculated the cost of parts while also starting to outline our timeline. This week was mainly talking with Afton's group and brainstorming how we wanted to do the linkage.

### Week 2
#### Reflection

This week we completed our planning document. We finished the timeline, code blocks, and the rest of the google doc. Then we created a github repo and moved all of the information from the doc to the github planning document. We fleshed out a more concrete plan with aftons group and made our schedueles so that there was a lot of overlap and we would check in every now and then.

### Week 3
#### Reflection

This week we prototyped the PLAIN with shop materials. Vinnie was out sick this week so Matthias had to take charge and created our prototype. Matthias made it out of wood, styrofoam, a 9v battery, and a motor. The prototype did not fly and was not areodynamic at all. The only thing that worked was the switch that was soldiered to the motor and turned it on. We decided that it was best to move on with the project and not waste too much time trying to made a working prototype.

## Phase_1
### Week 4
#### Reflection

This week we worked together to make the first prototype in CAD. A general style was followed rather than planning for real world functionality. The only thing that was made to realistic standards was the air foil of the aft horizontal stabilizers. The air foil was made with a spline and modeling a common RC plane air foil.
