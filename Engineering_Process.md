## Identify_Problem  
Our problem is that there is only 1 runway and a limited time of takeoff but we have 2 planes that need to fly in different directions and gather different data. 


## Identify_resources_and_constraints
One resource constraint is not being able to get the right motor without having to spend a lot of money. We do not have any very lightweight motors that put out the force we need. There is a chance we run out of time to complete the final touch ups and the project is not ready on launch day. Another constraint is that there are specific lightweight servos to adjust the flaps in RC planes, and the circuit boards are made in a factory line to be small, lightweight, and have minimal jumper wires. 


## Brainstorm_ideas
We could shoot a plane or an object with a parachute in a slingshot.

We could attach 2 planes together side-by-side and disconnect in the air

We could make a small plane inside of a bigger plane and then release the small plane when we are in the air

We could make two parts to the same plane that split off and go different directions
