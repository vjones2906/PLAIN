### Scope
The goal of the project is to work with Afton and Matthew in order to create 2 planes that take off linked together and then split into 2 different planes after receiving the signal. Once the planes detach, each group will take their own readings of either altitude, pressure, temperature, max height, max tilt, or length of flight. We have split this project into 4 stages for our group. The first stage will be creating a body that can glide without a motor and produce some sort of lift. The next stage will include a motor and prop, and we will achieve a solo takeoff. Stage 3 is a successful attaching and detaching mechanism with our sister aircraft. The last stage is linked takeoff and detachment in the air while collecting data.
